## Overview

Metrics normalize key values (e.g., Revenue, Gross Profit, Net Income) across units and periods. Two types are supported:

- QuickBooks metrics: Extract values from Profit & Loss or Balance Sheet
- Formula metrics: Combine other metrics with equations

Use metrics in Benchmarks, Scorecards, and custom reports.

## Create a QuickBooks metric

<DevOnly>[Insert Screenshot of New Metric (QuickBooks)]</DevOnly>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Metrics settings">Go to **Settings > Metrics**.</Step>
  <Step title="Add metric">Choose **QuickBooks** and name your metric (e.g., Total Income).</Step>
  <Step title="Match value">Pick the report and matching strategy:
  - exact: match a row by name
  - sectionTotal: use the section summary (e.g., Gross Profit)
  - groupSummary: use a groupâ€™s summary row
  Provide the matching value (name or section).</Step>
</Steps>

Notes:

- Frequency is monthly; units and formats are fixed for QuickBooks metrics
- Only units with connected QuickBooks data are included

## Create a formula metric

<DevOnly>[Insert Screenshot of New Metric (Formula)]</DevOnly>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add metric">Choose **Formula**, then define the equation.</Step>
  <Step title="Reference metrics">Use IDs from existing metrics as variables.</Step>
  <Step title="Set display">Choose unit (number, currency, percent) and format.</Step>
</Steps>

Tips:

- Avoid circular references; the app guards against loops
- Stick with organization-wide metrics to ensure comparability

## Use cases

- Benchmarks: Select which metrics appear in benchmark comparisons
- Scorecards: Display a summary of core KPIs
- Reports: Insert live KPIs or comparisons via blocks (where available)
