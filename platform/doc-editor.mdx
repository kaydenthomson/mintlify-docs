Tip: Use the floating toolbar to format text (bold, italic, underline, code) and insert links.

## Benchmarks block

Use Benchmarks to compare KPIs across units, brands, states, or tags for a specific month.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add block">Type “/benchmarks” and select Benchmarks.</Step>
  <Step title="Choose period">Select month and year.</Step>
  <Step title="Choose group">Pick Unit, Brand, State, or Tag, then select a target.</Step>
  <Step title="Sync data">Open settings and click **Sync** to snapshot results.</Step>
</Steps>

Notes:

- Only QuickBooks-backed metrics can be added to the benchmark list.
- Results exclude units without data for the selected period.

See Benchmarks for configuring which KPIs appear.

## Media and files

Upload files directly or reference existing files. File placeholders help when content is pending. The app cleans up unused uploads when you close the editor.

## Layout and navigation

- Columns: Split content into two or three columns for summaries
- TOC: Add a table of contents for long pages
- Callouts: Emphasize insights, warnings, or summaries

## Best practices

- Keep sections short with clear headings
- Use lists for steps and comparisons
- Prefer organization-wide metrics for consistency
- Avoid re-creating data tables—use Benchmarks or include screenshots when needed

## Reports differences

Reports use the same editor but are geared for external sharing:

- Sent reports are read-only
- Email delivery with analytics (delivered, clicked, viewed)
- Use contact lists to send at once

For sending and analytics, see Reports.
