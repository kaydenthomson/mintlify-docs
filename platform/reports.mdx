## Overview

Reports allow you to create, publish, and share customizable, presentation-ready pages using the Doc Editor. Unlike traditional financial reports, these are professional, branded pages built from content blocks and data, shared as secure, view-only links with delivery analytics.

**Key Benefits**:

- Create polished updates and summaries without exporting PDFs or combining documents.
- Reuse Doc Editor blocks for consistent formatting.
- Email reports to contacts or lists with tracked engagement.

After sending a report, analytics appear in the report header:

- **Link Clicked**: Number of recipients who clicked the report link.
- **Report Viewed**: Number of signed-in recipients who viewed the report.

**Recipient Details**:

## Data Blocks and Metrics

<DevOnly>[Insert screenshot of data blocks in Doc Editor]</DevOnly>

Data blocks enhance reports by embedding dynamic financial and operational metrics directly in the Doc Editor. These blocks pull live data from connected sources, such as accounting platforms (e.g., QuickBooks), to create insightful, professional visuals and summaries.

### Available Now: Benchmarks Block

The Benchmarks block compares a unit's financial <Tooltip tip="Key performance indicators combining multiple financial measures">KPIs</Tooltip> against peer benchmarks across your accessible units for a selected time period.

**At a glance**:

- Contrast a unit's KPIs with peer averages for any selected month or quarter, with variance callouts for fast review.
- Pull consolidated per-unit metrics directly from connected accounting platforms like QuickBooks.
- Add the Benchmarks block in the Doc Editor, choose the period, scope, and KPIs, then publish.
- Share the rendered comparison table or list so teams can spot over- or under-performance in context.

### Coming Soon: Additional Data Blocks

## Organize Reports with Report Groups

<DevOnly>[Insert screenshot of groups sidebar]</DevOnly>

2. In the left sidebar, click **New Group**.
3. Enter a group name (e.g., "Quarterly Reports") and press **Enter**.
   - Names cannot be empty. Invalid names revert with an error message.

**Add Reports to a Group**:

1. When creating a report, select an existing group in the **New Report** modal.
   - The report is automatically filed into the chosen group.
2. For existing reports:
   - In the Reports list, use the table’s context menu to select **Move to Group** and choose a group.
   - Alternatively, drag and drop reports into a group in the sidebar.
