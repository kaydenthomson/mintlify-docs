## What You Can Do

- **View Standard Reports**: Access Profit & Loss (P&L), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow statements.
- **Build Custom Reports**: Use the **Reports Builder** to create tailored financial views with metrics, tables, and charts.
- **Consolidate Data**: Roll up financials for specific units, brands, or the entire organization.
- **Integrate Data Sources**: Combine accounting (e.g., QuickBooks), banking (e.g., Plaid), and POS data.

## Data sources

Coverpanda integrates multiple data sources to provide comprehensive financial insights.

### Accounting (QuickBooks)

- Imports period-based statements (P&L, Balance Sheet).
- Standardizes chart of accounts for consistent cross-unit comparisons.
- Supports unit-level connections and organization-wide rollups.

### Banking (Plaid)

- Securely links bank accounts per unit.
- Syncs transactions and balances to validate cash positions and inflows/outflows.
- Enables cash trend tracking and reconciliation alongside accounting data.

### Point of Sale (POS)

- Integrates sales and operational data into financial reports.
- Compares sales trends with bank deposits and accounting revenue.
- Currently supports Square, with more POS systems planned.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open integrations">Go to **Settings > Integrations**.</Step>
  <Step title="Connect sources">
    Select **QuickBooks**, **Plaid**, and optionally **Square**, then authenticate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify sync">Confirm each connection shows a recent sync and no errors.</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  QuickBooks alone enables financial reporting. Adding banking and POS strengthens variance analysis and cash
  validation.
</Tip>

## Financial statements

View standard financial reports to monitor performance.

### Profit & Loss (P&L)

- Tracks Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Gross Profit, Operating Expenses, and Net Income.
- Filter by unit, brand, or organization and select a period (e.g., month, quarter, year).

### Balance sheet

- Displays Assets, Liabilities, and Equity at a specific point in time.
- Aligns with P&L period selection for consistent analysis.

### Cash flow (optional)

- Summarizes cash movements derived from accounting data, if enabled.

<Callout>Download P&L or Balance Sheet as spreadsheets from the report view.</Callout>

## Reports builder

Use the **Reports builder** to create custom reports with metrics, tables, and charts. For a deeper overview, see the **Reports** page: [Reports](./reports.mdx). For editor blocks and formatting, see [Doc Editor](./doc-editor.mdx).

## Consolidations and rollups

Aggregate financial data across units for unified insights.

**Features**:

- **Scope**: Select one unit, multiple units, or all units in the organization.
- **Standardized metrics**: Use consistent naming and matching rules to align categories across units.
- **Data accuracy**: Exclude units without data for the selected period to avoid skewed averages.
- **Time comparisons**: View current period, prior month, or year-over-year data.

**Tip**: Brand workspaces emphasize cross-operator rollups, while Operator workspaces focus on portfolio performance.

## Benchmarking and comparisons

Compare performance across units or against benchmarks.

### Side-by-side comparisons

- Display multiple units in one view with consistent metrics and statement sections.
- Toggle between absolute values (e.g., Revenue) and percentages (e.g., Gross Margin %).
- Apply filters (e.g., brand, region) and sort by KPIs to identify outliers.

### Financial benchmarking

- Set benchmarks (e.g., top quartile Gross Margin %, labor % targets).
- Compare units against benchmarks, highlighting deltas and trends.
- Exclude units without data to ensure accurate aggregations.

**Example**: Compare a store’s Gross Margin % (45%) against the top quartile benchmark (50%) to identify underperformance.

## Balance monitoring

Track cash and key balances with integrated data.

**Features**:

- **Cash position**: Compare accounting cash balances with real-time bank balances (Plaid).
- **Movement signals**: Detect unusual inflows/outflows or missing deposits.
- **Connection health**: Monitor bank sync status and last sync dates.

**Use Case**: Validate a unit’s cash balance in QuickBooks against Plaid data to spot reconciliation issues.

## Debt schedules (coming soon)

Track loans and obligations within financial reports.

**Planned features**:

- Record principal, interest, maturity, and payment schedules.
- Display upcoming payments and covenant metrics in reports.
- Include debt balances and amortization in consolidated views.

## Expense tracking (coming soon)

Gain deeper visibility into spending patterns.

**Planned features**:

- View category-level trends with alerts for unusual spikes.
- Summarize vendor-level spending across units.
- Link POS categories, accounting lines, and bank transactions for accuracy.

## Metrics

Metrics standardize key numbers for consistent tracking across units and periods.

**Types**:

- **QuickBooks-sourced**: Metrics like Revenue, COGS, or Payroll from standard reports.
- **Formula metrics**: Calculated values (e.g., Gross margin = Gross profit / Revenue).
- **Future sources**: POS and bank-derived metrics (e.g., deposit coverage ratio, same-store sales).

**Configuration**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open metrics">Go to **Settings > Metrics**.</Step>
  <Step title="Define and match">Create metrics and choose matching strategies (e.g., name or group).</Step>
  <Step title="Set behavior">
    Choose frequency (monthly), format (currency/percent), and aggregation rules.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Features**:

- Ensure accurate rollups by excluding units without data for the period.
- Use metrics in **Reports Builder** for dashboards and comparisons.

**Example**: Define a “Revenue” metric to track monthly sales across all units.

## Banking and POS overlays

Enhance financial reports with banking and POS data.

### Banking (Plaid)

- Display bank balances and transaction summaries alongside accounting KPIs.
- Identify timing differences (e.g., deposits vs. recognized revenue).
- Monitor connection health to resolve sync issues.

### POS

- Compare POS sales and refunds with accounting revenue and bank deposits.
- Detect mapping gaps or timing issues (e.g., batched deposits, processor delays).

**Use Case**: Spot a discrepancy between POS sales ($10k) and bank deposits ($9k) due to processing delays.

## Access and permissions

Control who sees financial data.

- **Organization-Level**: Restrict access to authorized users for specific units or reports.
- **Unit-Level**: Limit sensitive financials to permitted team members.
- **Exports**: Downloaded reports respect the user’s access level.

**How to manage**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open members">Go to **Settings > Members**.</Step>
  <Step title="Assign roles">Grant unit-level access and organization roles.</Step>
  <Step title="Review regularly">Audit access on a cadence to maintain security.</Step>
</Steps>

## Exports and sharing

Share financial insights with stakeholders.

- **Spreadsheet Exports**: Download P&L or Balance Sheet for a selected period.
- **Secure Links**: Share reports with specific units and date ranges as view-only links.

**How to share**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a report">In **Reports builder**, open the report you want to share.</Step>
  <Step title="Export or share">
    Click **Export** for spreadsheets or **Share** for a secure, view-only link.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting
