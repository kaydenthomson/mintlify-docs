## Overview

Benchmarks let you compare key metrics across your portfolio for a specific period. Configure the set of KPIs once, then insert a Benchmarks block in the Doc Editor to render comparisons.

## Configure benchmark items

Select which metrics are included in benchmark comparisons. Only QuickBooks-backed metrics are supported.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open settings">Go to **Settings > Benchmarks**.</Step>
  <Step title="Add KPIs">Choose metrics to include (e.g., Revenue, Gross Margin %, Labor %).</Step>
  <Step title="Order">Drag to reorder how KPIs appear in the block.</Step>
</Steps>

Notes:

- Metrics must be QuickBooks-sourced
- Frequency is monthly; values are looked up by month

## Insert a Benchmarks block

Use the Doc Editor to add a Benchmarks block to a page or report.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add block">Type “/benchmarks”.</Step>

  <Step title="Group by">Choose Unit, Brand, State, or Tag, then select a target.</Step>

Rendering:

- A compact list or table with KPI labels and values
- Progress bars for percent metrics
- Last updated timestamp for visibility

## Data conventions

- Exclude units without data for the selected month from averages
- Use standardized metrics to avoid name mismatches
- Bank/POS overlays are planned for future comparisons
