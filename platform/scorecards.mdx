## Build a scorecard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create scorecard">Name it and choose the evaluation range (e.g., last 6 months).</Step>
  <Step title="Select metrics">Pick metrics (QuickBooks or formula). Define direction (higher is better/worse) if supported.</Step>
  <Step title="Choose units">Include all or a filtered set (brand, region, tags).</Step>
</Steps>

## Reading a scorecard

- Bands: Poor, Fair, Strong, Super based on configured thresholds
- Trend: Compare current period to prior month or year
- Data gaps: Units without data for a month are excluded from that month’s aggregates
