## Overview

Use Files to manage uploads and pages across your organization, units, and rooms. You can link existing folders, upload new documents, and create pages with the Doc Editor.

## Link or create a folder

You can attach a folder to a Files page or a Room. Linking keeps content in sync with the source location.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Files">From a workspace or room, open the **Files** page.</Step>
  <Step title="Choose folder">Select **Link existing folder** or **Upload new documents**.</Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">If linking, pick an organization or unit folder and confirm.</Step>
</Steps>

Notes:

- Linked folders are read-only at the destination; manage changes at the source.
- New folders created here inherit room/workspace context and are editable.

## Upload and organize

- Drag and drop to upload
- Create folders for structure
- Move, rename, and delete files
- Create pages (Doc Editor) inside any folder

## Permissions and sharing

Folder sharing controls access. Permissions inherit from parent folders.

- Direct file sharing: grant view or edit on a single file
- Folder inheritance: subfolders and files inherit parent access
- Linked folder access: governed by the source folder’s sharing

If a collaborator can’t see a file, check the parent folder’s sharing and the room membership.

## Use files in pages and reports

- Insert images, videos, and files directly from the editor
- Replace placeholders once files are available
- Unused uploads are automatically cleaned up

See Doc Editor for inserting media and placeholders.
