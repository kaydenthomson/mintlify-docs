## Templates

Save templates for common workflows:

- Report templates with pre-filled structure and live data blocks (coming soon)
- Page templates for recurring updates
- Checklist templates to standardize tasks and requests

## Saved blocks

Save frequently used blocks (e.g., callouts, tables, KPI sections) to insert quickly into the Doc Editor.
