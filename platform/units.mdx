## Overview

Units represent individual locations or entities in your organization. Connect integrations, manage files, and use unit data in Reports, Benchmarks, and Scorecards.

## Connect integrations

For the most value, connect QuickBooks, Banking, and POS per unit.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Integrations">Go to **Settings > Integrations**.</Step>
  <Step title="Connect QuickBooks">Authorize the unit’s QuickBooks company.</Step>
  <Step title="Optional: Banking/POS">Link banking via Plaid and POS (e.g., Square) to enrich reports.</Step>
</Steps>

Notes:

- Financial reports work with QuickBooks alone; banking/POS add cash and sales context
- Monitor sync status in the Financials area

## Files and pages

Each unit can have file folders and Doc Editor pages. Use Files to organize contracts, SOPs, or audits.

## Forms

Publish forms for unit submissions (e.g., onboarding checklists). See Forms for builder details.

## Access

Grant access to specific units for users and organizations. Folder-level sharing inherits to subfolders and files. If users can’t see a file, verify both unit access and folder sharing.
