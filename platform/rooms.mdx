## What is a room

Rooms are collaborative spaces where your team and external partners work together. A room combines what used to be called “datarooms,” “projects,” and “workspaces” into a single place for:

- Documents and files
- Pages built with the Doc Editor
- Tasks and checklists
- Forms and submissions
- Published reports and share links

Rooms live inside an organization. You add members to a room and control what they can see or edit.

## Create a room

<DevOnly>[Insert Screenshot of New Room]</DevOnly>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Rooms">Go to your organization and open **Rooms**.</Step>
  <Step title="Create room">Click **New room** and enter a name and optional description.</Step>
  <Step title="Invite members">Add teammates or external partners. Choose their role (view or edit).</Step>
</Steps>

Tip: You can create a room from common workflows like due diligence, board updates, or vendor onboarding.

## Room structure

Every room follows the same structure so teams always know where to go.

- Overview: Key details, recent activity, and quick links
- Documents: Files and pages (Doc Editor) organized in folders
- Tasks: Kanban-style board to track work
- Forms: Published forms and submissions scoped to the room
- Reports: Branded, view-only pages you can send and track
- People: Members, roles, and invitations

## Documents and pages

Documents include uploaded files and pages created with the Doc Editor.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload or link folders">Use **Documents** to upload files or link an existing organization/unit folder.</Step>
  <Step title="Create pages">Click **New page** to open the Doc Editor for notes, updates, or templates.</Step>
  <Step title="Organize">Drag to move files/pages. Use folders to keep things tidy.</Step>
</Steps>

Permissions inherit from linked folders. See File management for details.

## Tasks

Use the Tasks board to plan and execute work inside the room. Tasks support sections/stages, drag-and-drop, and quick adds.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add stages">Create columns for your workflow (e.g., To do, In progress, Done).</Step>
  <Step title="Create tasks">Use the inline add field in a column.</Step>
  <Step title="Reorder">Drag tasks or stages to reprioritize.</Step>
</Steps>

## Forms

Attach existing forms or create new ones for data collection (e.g., onboarding details, document requests).

<DevOnly>[Insert Screenshot of Room Forms]</DevOnly>

- Publish a form to make it available
- Members submit once or update if allowed
- View recent submissions in a side drawer

See Forms for building and publishing forms.

## Reports

Share branded, view-only updates. Reports are pages built with the Doc Editor, emailed to contacts with engagement analytics.

<DevOnly>[Insert Screenshot of Room Reports]</DevOnly>

- Draft in the editor; send to contacts or lists
- Track delivered, clicked, and viewed
- Sent reports become read-only for consistency

See Reports to learn sending and analytics. Use Doc Editor for content basics.

## People and access

Manage who can see and edit content in the room.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invite members">Open **People** and click **Invite**.</Step>
  <Step title="Set roles">Choose **Viewer** or **Editor** depending on access needs.</Step>
  <Step title="Remove access">Revoke access from the People tab at any time.</Step>
</Steps>

Linked folders inherit permissions from source locations. When in doubt, check the source folder’s sharing settings.

## Payments (coming soon)

Collect payments inside a room for services or requests. Integrations will use Stripe Connect for payouts and item pricing.
