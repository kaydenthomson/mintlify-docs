This guide introduces Coverpanda’s core building blocks to help you navigate the platform and select the right tools for your tasks.

## Organizations

An organization represents your company or brand, serving as the hub for managing data, members, and settings.

**Features**:

- Invite and manage members with role-based permissions.
- Control access to data and features at the organization level.
- Switch between multiple organizations if you belong to more than one.

### Organization Workspace Types

Coverpanda offers two workspace types to align with your operating model: Operator and Brand. Each type tailors the interface and defaults to your needs, while core features like reporting and integrations stay available.

#### Operator Workspace

- **Purpose**: Built for operators managing one or more units (stores, franchises, or entities).
- **Features**: Highlights unit dashboards, simplifies permission updates, guides data source setup, and surfaces unit-specific KPIs.
- **When to Use**: Focus on day-to-day execution and local performance across one or many locations.
- **Example**: A portfolio operator running three "North Coast Coffee" shops monitors sales and access per location.

#### Brand Workspace

- **Purpose**: Serves franchisors or brand teams overseeing multiple operators and units.
- **Features**: Standardizes templates, enforces brand-wide metrics, and provides rollup analytics across operators.
- **When to Use**: Coordinate compliance, reporting, and analytics for a network of operators or units.
- **Example**: The "Sunrise Hospitality" brand office tracks revenue and compliance across 50 franchise locations.

## Units

Units are individual locations or entities, such as stores, franchises, or legal entities, each with its own data and permissions.

**Features**:

- Store operational and financial data specific to each unit.
- Assign unit-level permissions to restrict access for local teams.
- Generate reports scoped to a single unit or aggregated across multiple units.
- Transfer unit ownership or approve access requests.

**When to Use**:

- Manage location-specific data or permissions.
- Compare performance across locations.

<Note>Keep unit naming consistent with POS or accounting systems so data syncs stay traceable.</Note>

**Example**: Create a unit for “Store #123” to track its sales data and restrict access to its manager.

## Data Sources

Data sources connect external systems to power reports and analytics with real-time data.

**Supported Sources**:

- **Accounting**: Link platforms like QuickBooks to import financial data, organize tax materials, and standardize accounts.
- **Banking**: Connect bank accounts securely to monitor balances and transactions.
- **Point of Sale (POS)**: Integrate sales data to enrich reports and track operations.

**How to Connect**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Integrations">Go to **Settings > Integrations**.</Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate the source">
    Select a data source and follow the prompts to authorize the connection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor sync status">
    Check the connection indicators to confirm data updates continue to flow.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**When to Use**:

- Enable reporting with live financial or operational data.
- Automate data-driven insights across units.

<Note>Verify connections regularly to avoid sync issues.</Note>

## Reports

Reports transform data into actionable insights for monitoring and sharing performance.

**Features**:

- Use the **Reports Builder** to create custom reports with metrics and data blocks.
- Access standard financial reports, such as Profit & Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow.
- Share reports as secure, view-only links or export them for stakeholders.

**How to Create**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Reports">Go to **Organization > Reports**.</Step>
  <Step title="Start a draft">Click **New Report** to launch the **Reports Builder**.</Step>
  <Step title="Configure and share">
    Pick metrics, date ranges, and data blocks, then save or send the report.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>Save frequently used layouts as templates so future reports only need refreshed metrics.</Tip>

**When to Use**:

- Track performance across units or organizations.
- Share insights with stakeholders, such as investors or managers.

**Learn More**: See [Reports Builder](#reports-builder) for details.

## Metrics

Metrics are the key numbers you track to measure performance across units and time periods.

**Features**:

- Define and group metrics (e.g., Revenue, EBITDA) for use in reports and data blocks.
- Apply aggregation rules to ensure accurate rollups (e.g., exclude units without data for a period).
- Configure metrics to align with your business needs.

**When to Use**:

- Standardize performance indicators across locations.
- Compare unit or organization-wide performance over time.

<Tip>Keep metric names and formulas consistent so dashboards stay aligned across teams.</Tip>

**Example**: Define a "Gross Margin %" metric to compare profitability across all stores in Q3 2025.

## Next Steps

- **Get Started**: Learn the basics in [Getting Started](#getting-started).
- **Connect Data**: Set up data sources in **Settings > Integrations**.
